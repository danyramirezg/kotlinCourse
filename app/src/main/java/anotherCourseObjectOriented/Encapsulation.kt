    Exercise: Encapsulation and scope

    A famous fast food restaurant has a secret formula for their burgers.

    A franchise of this brand can sell burgers, but does not have access to the formula. They have to ask the original restaurant how to prepare the food.

    Implement this in a program, and call the franchise object to provide you with burgers.
