    Exercise: Inheritance
    A class Father has a first name and last name. It also has a function that prints out the
    personâ€™s name.

    A class Son inherits from Father and overrides the first name. It also overrides the message
    function, which now prints out both the name of the person, and the name of the father.

    Implement this structure in a program.
